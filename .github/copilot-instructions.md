## Overview
A 2D fantasy sandbox game with local split-screen co-op for two players. Built in **Godot 4.3 stable** using **GDScript** as the primary language UNLESS performance-critical systems require C#/GDExtension (chunked terrain, block grids). All art assets come from the **Kenney All-in-One** asset pack (CC0 license).

## Key Notes
- You maintain these instruction files. If you make any changes to the game, please make sure the instruction files are updated to match the changes. You are allowed and encouraged to make skills as well.
- When in planning mode, do not try to make changes. Not even with as subagent
- Always ask questions when in planning mode
- When you ready this, say "Hello there matey!" so that I know you read this.
- Use local ./tmp instead of /tmp because you don't have permission to write to /tmp
- Anytime a sprite is added, make sure it's also available and mappable in the sprite tool

## Mining System
Mining is **tile-based** — decorations are painted on a `TileMapLayer` (`Decoration`), not placed as individual `Sprite2D` nodes. `WorldRoot` owns all mining state.

### Data constants (in `world_root.gd`)
- `MINEABLE_HP` — maps decoration `StringName` to base HP: tree(3), bush(1), rock(5), iron_vein(6), copper_vein(5), gold_vein(8).
- `MINEABLE_DROPS` — maps decoration kind to `Array[{id: StringName, count: int}]`.
- `PICKAXE_BONUS_KINDS` — rock, iron_vein, copper_vein, gold_vein. The pickaxe doubles mining damage against these kinds.

### Runtime flow
1. `_build_mineable_index()` scans `_region.decorations` and builds `_mineable: Dictionary` (Vector2i → `{kind, hp}`).
2. `PlayerController._physics_process` checks attack input, enforces a **0.35 s cooldown** (`ATTACK_COOLDOWN_SEC`), then calls `try_attack()`.
3. `try_attack()` calls `_compute_mine_damage(target_cell)` — base damage is 1; doubles to 2 if the player has a pickaxe equipped (`ItemDefinition.Slot.TOOL`) and the target kind is in `PICKAXE_BONUS_KINDS`.
4. `WorldRoot.mine_at(cell, damage)` decrements HP. On destruction it erases the tile (plus canopy tile above for tall decorations), clears the overlay, and returns drop info.
5. `spawn_break_burst()` / `spawn_hit_burst()` create short-lived `CPUParticles2D` for visual feedback.

### Important: Hittable.gd is deleted
The old `Hittable` component (Sprite2D-child, HP + signals) has been removed. All mining goes through the tile-based `mine_at()` path.

## Items & Equipment
- `ItemDefinition` (`scripts/data/item_definition.gd`) — Resource with `id: StringName`, `display_name`, `icon_idx`, `slot: Slot`, `power`, `max_stack`, `description`.
  - `enum Slot { NONE, WEAPON, TOOL, HEAD, BODY, FEET }`.
- `ItemRegistry` (`scripts/data/item_registry.gd`) — static cache of all `ItemDefinition`s. Registered items: wood, stone, fiber, iron_ore, copper_ore, gold_ore, sword, bow, pickaxe, helmet, armor, boots.
- `Inventory` (`scripts/data/inventory.gd`) — 24-slot array on each `PlayerController`.
- `Equipment` (`scripts/data/equipment.gd`) — per-slot dict. `equip(slot, id)`, `unequip(slot)`, `get_equipped(slot) -> StringName`, `total_power(slot)`. Emits `contents_changed` signal on changes.
- `WeaponAtlas` (`scripts/data/weapon_atlas.gd`) — maps item ID → character-sheet atlas cell for the persistent weapon sprite. Reads from `TileMappings.weapon_sprites` (SpritePicker-editable), falls back to coded defaults.

## Action Animations (VFX)
Visual feedback for attacks and gathering. Implemented as tween-driven temporary sprites + particles.

### Architecture
- `ActionVFX` (`scripts/entities/action_vfx.gd`) — Node2D child of Player root (not under SpriteRoot, so it doesn't h-flip). Plays four action types: melee swing, mine swing, gather rustle, ranged shot. Prevents overlapping animations via `_is_playing`.
- `ActionParticles` (`scripts/entities/action_particles.gd`) — static helper that spawns themed `CPUParticles2D` with texture from `assets/particles/pack/` (slash, spark, dirt, smoke, star). Selects texture by action type + target kind.
- Persistent weapon `Sprite2D` on `SpriteRoot/Weapon` — shows equipped weapon/tool at all times. Updated via `_update_weapon_sprite()` connected to `Equipment.contents_changed`. Display priority: WEAPON > TOOL.
- `TileMappings.weapon_sprites` — SpritePicker-editable field mapping item IDs to character-sheet cells. Registered in SpritePicker `_MAPPINGS` as "Weapon / tool sprites".

### Action flow in `try_attack()`
1. Damage applied instantly (frame 0) — animation is purely cosmetic.
2. Action type determined: mineable + pickaxe → `play_mine_swing()`; mineable + bare hands → `play_gather()`; weapon + bow → `play_ranged()`; weapon + melee → `play_melee_swing()`; nothing → particle-only punch.
3. Destruction triggers `ActionParticles.Action.BREAK` burst (replaces old `spawn_break_burst()`).
4. All animation durations (0.15–0.3s) fit within the 0.35s attack cooldown.

### Gather tile-shake
- Copies the decoration tile to a temp `Sprite2D`, hides the real tile, oscillates ±2px for 3 cycles, then restores. `TileMapLayer` doesn't support per-cell transforms, so this swap technique is necessary.

## Auto-Mine & Auto-Attack
Toggle-based automation on `PlayerController`. Input actions `p*_auto_mine` (C / Numpad 7) and `p*_auto_attack` (V / Numpad 8) flip booleans `auto_mine` / `auto_attack`.

### Auto-mine
- When `auto_mine == true` and attack cooldown is ready, `_tick_auto_mine()` scans all cells within `_AUTO_MINE_RADIUS` (1 tile) for entries in `_world._mineable`.
- Picks the nearest mineable (Manhattan distance), faces it, applies `_compute_mine_damage()`, calls `mine_at()`, plays VFX, collects drops. Resets cooldown.

### Auto-attack
- When `auto_attack == true` and cooldown ready, `_tick_auto_attack()` dispatches by equipped weapon.
- **Melee** (`_auto_attack_melee`): scans `_world.entities` for hostile `NPC` (`.hostile && hp > 0`) or `Monster` (`.health > 0`) within `_MELEE_REACH_PX` (24 px). Faces nearest target, calls `take_hit(power, self)`, plays melee VFX.
- **Ranged / bow** (`_auto_attack_ranged`): fires in current `_facing_dir` every cooldown. Checks entities in that direction within `_RANGED_REACH_PX` (80 px) using dot-product alignment (> 0.7). First aligned hostile takes damage.

### UI highlight
- `ControlsHud` uses `RichTextLabel` with BBCode. When `auto_mine` or `auto_attack` is active on the player, the line renders bold green with "(ON)" suffix.
- `_process()` polls the player booleans for instant UI feedback.

## Dialogue System
- Data layer: `DialogueTree → DialogueNode → DialogueChoice` (Resource subclasses in `scripts/data/`).
- `GameState` autoload (`scripts/autoload/game_state.gd`): `String → bool` flag dict for quest/world state. No `class_name` (autoload name is the accessor).
- Player stats: `Dictionary` on `PlayerController` (`{ &"charisma": 3, &"wisdom": 3, &"strength": 3 }`).
- `DialogueBox` (`scripts/ui/dialogue_box.gd`): CanvasLayer (layer 40), two modes — one-liner and branching.
- Branching flow: `WorldRoot.show_dialogue_tree(player, tree)` → `DialogueBox.show_node()` → `choice_selected` signal → `_on_choice_selected`.
- NPC scatter entries support an optional `"dialogue": "res://path.tres"` key.
- Mara the Herbalist: auto-injected near spawn via `_maybe_inject_mara()`.
- Seeder scripts in `tools/` (e.g. `seed_healer_mara.gd`) build `.tres` files via `ResourceSaver`.
